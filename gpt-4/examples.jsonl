{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ with ESRD on ___ dialysis, right loop forearm AV graft placed on ___, well controlled bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, presents with suspected cellulitis of R forearm graft. Ultrasound of the area determined an abscess in close proximity to the AV graft, rending the graft unusable for hemodialysis. A tunneled HD line was placed, and surgery removed the graft. # AV Graft Cellulitis: There waserythema over AV graft site that improved with antibiotics per patient report. Swab cultures reportedly grew MRSA at OSH; however here grew MSSA. IV vancomycin was administered after dialysis sessions. Ultrasound determined that an abscess was formed adjacent to the AV graft, rendering the graft unusable for hemodialysis. The AV graft was removed, and a new brachiocephalic fistula was created. A tunneled HD line was also placed for hemodialysis until the new fistula matures. During this admission, his blood cultures had no growth. He was also afebrile with other vital signs stable. He will continue outpatient vancomycin to complete 2 week course. # Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia to 86 on admission but uptrending on discharge. Patient has history of HIT but no recent heparin exposure. Thought possibly medication related. # ESRD: on ___ dialysis. His ___ session (___) was skipped because there was no access site. His electrolytes remained stable during this time. A new AV fistula was created, and a tunneled HD catheter was placed for ongoing HD. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -Follow up transplant surgery in 1 week -Will need to continue vancomycin dosed with HD until ___. This will be dosed by level.", "gold_summary": "You were admitted to the hospital because of your hemodialysis graft infection. Transplant surgery removed the graft and created an AV fistula that can be used for dialysis in the future after it has matured. Interventional radiology also placed a hemodialysis line that can be used before the fistula has matured. You will continue vancomycin for 2 weeks to finish treating the infection, and you will receive this medication at dialysis."}
